Hey Everyone! This is my first blog post on Github Pages. Sorry about the generic layout, will be working on that soon!

A few weeks ago I graduated Launch Academy, which was one of the best experiences of my life. I barely had enough time to keep up day to day necessities let alone blog, so now I plan on making up for it.

I've applied to at least a handful of companies in Boston, but after returning to Vegas I've realized that I want to expand my opportunities. I'm applying all over the country now.

I forgot how much I missed the west coast and west in general, so I'm excited to be back for now. But if any of you employers are reading this, I honestly am open to moving anymore and love new cities, people, and environments.

Okay, so you might have read the title. Coding in the wilderness? Montana? Is this guy joking?

I'm completely serious! I'm going up to my mountain ranch nestled into the Salish Mountain range at the base of a majestic pass (Look it up! Therrihault Pass and Lakes).

Why? Because after a summer of coding for 12 hours a day indoors, I'd like to do something different. I want to take my time and find a company I will wake up every day excited for. I'll still be working on my projects and skills, but I'll be doing it with an amazing view.

The funny part is, the house we have there has never had internet. In fact, its so remote that when I called the ISP I realized that I didn't even know our address! We don't even have a mailbox or a paved road.

The land was settled in the later 1800's by a hardworking Amish family (as far as I know). The original owner walked to work every day, a 30 minute drive down the mountain.

It's going to be a surreal experience working in technology surrounded by the great outdoors. But I'm looking forward to this frankenstein experience of new and old worlds and hope you follow along!
