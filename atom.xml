    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I decided to take a short break from coding to document my retreat in the mountains. I just accepted my offer from Pavlok, a company that embraces change as its mantra.</p>

<p>Before the chaos of real life resumes, I would like to pause for a moment in time and transport you here to Montana - my storied past here is a dichotomy of change and my resistance to it.</p>

<p>The silence here is deafening. You often hear the cliche term describing the absence of silence. But you haven&rsquo;t truly experienced silence until you are almost a hundred miles away from the nearest cities, nestled into the mountains, cradled in history from inhabitant to inhabitant.</p>

<p>This is a silence of three parts. The first type of silence is obvious. The mountains lack the heartbeat of civilization or outside noise of any sort. The kind of absence where your ears start ringing and you can hear your blood pumping to fill it in.</p>

<p>The second silence is one you have to strain to hear. It is the muted pitter patter of rain on the roof and the pattern of my fingers lightly touching the keyboard. Besides my computer, the only other reminder of technology is a refridgerator humming lightly in the kitchen. Faint sounds like these only serve to remind you of the isolation.</p>

<p>The last silence is intangable. It is the silence that is haunting and everpresent. Of change and decay. My first memories of this place were vibrant and curious. I had no concept of nature reclaiming its rightful ownership.</p>

<p>Each year I visit, I am reminded that the cabin, lakes, trails, and all human establishments are being eaten away little by little. The land changes hands and the people close to me, attached to it like I am erode from its history like wood eaten by mould.</p>

<p>I am what is left. This is my silence.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hey Everyone! This is my first blog post on Github Pages. Sorry about the generic layout, will be working on that soon!</p>

<p>A few weeks ago I graduated Launch Academy, which was one of the best experiences of my life. I barely had enough time to keep up day to day necessities let alone blog, so now I plan on making up for it.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve applied to at least a handful of companies in Boston, but after returning to Vegas I&rsquo;ve realized that I want to expand my opportunities. I&rsquo;m applying all over the country now.</p>

<p>I forgot how much I missed the west coast and west in general, so I&rsquo;m excited to be back for now. But if any of you employers are reading this, I honestly am open to moving anymore and love new cities, people, and environments.</p>

<p>Okay, so you might have read the title. Coding in the wilderness? Montana? Is this guy joking?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m completely serious! I&rsquo;m going up to my mountain ranch nestled into the Salish Mountain range at the base of a majestic pass (Look it up! Therrihault Pass and Lakes).</p>

<p>Why? Because after a summer of coding for 12 hours a day indoors, I&rsquo;d like to do something different. I want to take my time and find a company I will wake up every day excited for. I&rsquo;ll still be working on my projects and skills, but I&rsquo;ll be doing it with an amazing view.</p>

<p>The funny part is, the house we have there has never had internet. In fact, its so remote that when I called the ISP I realized that I didn&rsquo;t even know our address! We don&rsquo;t even have a mailbox or a paved road.</p>

<p>The land was settled in the later 1800&rsquo;s by a hardworking Amish family (as far as I know). The original owner walked to work every day, a 30 minute drive down the mountain.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s going to be a surreal experience working in technology surrounded by the great outdoors. But I&rsquo;m looking forward to this frankenstein experience of new and old worlds and hope you follow along!</p>
